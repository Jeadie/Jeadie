# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### Now
Iâ€™m working in engineering at [Spice ai](https://www.spice.ai/), we're building [spice](https://github.com/spiceai/spiceai), a unified SQL query interface to locally accelerate and query data tables sourced from any database, data warehouse, or data lake. Built with Rust and modern data tooling: Apache Flight, Apache Datafusion, DuckDB and more!

I also focus on the AI building blocks & infrastructure for the Spice platform. Think: training pipelines, inference (server & on the edge), understanding the industry & technical SOTA time-series ML, and designing an intuitive & powerful developer experience. 

### Past
- I led & built the managed cloud service for [Marqo.ai](https://github.com/marqo-ai/marqo), from onboarding our very first customer to our first public, enterprise customer.

- 18 months at Amazon working on groceries (think Whole Foods and Amazon Fresh), improving recommendations and the customer impact of when groceries are out of stock.

- ~ 3 years working at [MaxwellPlus](https://www.maxwellplus.com/), where we did some awesome work (see [[1]](https://cloud.google.com/customers/maxwell-plus/) & [[2]](https://nhsaccelerator.com/innovation/maxwell-plus/)). I spent my time across AI research, ML + data engineering and infrastructure + devops.

- I studied both mathematics (mainly pure) + software engineering at UQ. I wish I did even more math.
